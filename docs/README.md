# VSVIZ

> VSVIZ is a framework for auto collecting & visualizing data based on Web.

## What is it

Well, at the very beginning, this project is created for visualizing data from [ROS](https://www.ros.org/). And still, it works fine with ROS. But you can also use vsviz to display data from other data source, cause vsviz only rely on tcp socket to receive raw data. 

## Examples

VSVIZ github repos provides with several examples, please [check out](https://github.com/purpose233/vsviz/tree/master/example).
